MacOS Arm has an issue with ansible. Go to vagrant folder or run on linux (ubuntu) VM

run the remotiing.ps1 file on windows ===> this should open the 5985 and 5986 port
check the security group 
check the firewall
check_winrm.ps1 file on windows ==> to check the listner, service for winrm

ansible www01 -m win_ping -i inventory_winrm_5986
